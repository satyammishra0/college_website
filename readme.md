I BUILT PROJECTS WITH HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL

This one is a sample website which can be used as school/ college 🏫🚸 website.
Made with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL ) + lots of love 💘💖

This website has a nice and simple web interface to interact new gen users so its made with dark theme so that users can use anytime which is simple adn with html and css only which users can see and go through.

But in the wesite there is a admin panel too with which you can ( CREATE || READ || UPDATE || DELETE ) which is made with PHP and SQL With a moderate (LOGIN || LOGOUT ) feature too just a lst feqature missing in it which is to hash the password.

To visit the website :: https://basketball-tournament.000webhostapp.com/
To see the admin panel :: https://basketball-tournament.000webhostapp.com/admin

But to enter the website you need the password and email id and to get that you need to contact me 😂😂 :: satyamjay007@gmail.com
